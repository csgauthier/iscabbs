## Developer notes. Mostly likely incorrect.

* Compilation: the Makefile works. It has two targets.
  'bbs' is the server. 
  'setupbbs' is the setup program.

* Configure the ROOT dir, UID, GID in 'bbs.h'.
  For testing, I used '/tmp/whatever', and my own UID/GID.
  Re-compile everything since these are hard-coded in the headers.

* Create the dir structure under the ROOT.
  mkdir -p ROOT/{data,etc,etc/who,help,message,message/desc}

* Run bbsetup. Use strace if it fails. It failed for me because
  of missing the dir structure created in the previous step.

* Run bbs -i. I think this initializes things. I don't know.

* Run bbs. Type `New` to create a new user.
